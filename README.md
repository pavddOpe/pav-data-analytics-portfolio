# Data Analycis Portfolio

Hi! I'm Pavlo, a data enthusiast passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights.  
I enjoy working with SQL, Excel, Tableau, Python, Power BI and other tools to solve real-world problems (for instance SAP & Salesforce).

Here are some of my completed projects (more coming soon!):

## Projects

### 1. Data Cleaning - Global Layoffs 2020-2023 (MySQL)
Cleaned a dataset of tech industry layoffs during and post-COVID era.
Removed duplicates, standardized text values, handled NULLs and blanks, converted data types, created own system of measuring the quality of data + summarizing report.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis Project - Layoffs 2022 (above related; My SQL)
Deep dive into trends using advanced SQL:  
- Total/percentage layoffs by company, industry, country, funding stage, and time  
- Monthly trends with rolling (cumulative) totals using window functions  
- Yearly top 5 companies by layoffs using CTEs and DENSE_RANK()

### 3. Bike Buyers Dashboard (Excel)
Built a fully interactive dashboard analyzing customer behavior and factors influencing bike purchases (1,000 records)
Core features: pivot tables, pivot charts, slicers, dynamic layout  
- Added calculated columns using advanced formulas – e.g., Income Brackets, "Has Kids", ordered Commute Distance  
- KPI cards at the top (Total Customers, Purchase Rate %, Avg. Income, Avg. Age)  
- All pivots connected via Data Model for full cross-filtering  
- VBA macro with refresh button to update all pivots instantly
