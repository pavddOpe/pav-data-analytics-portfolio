## Tableau Project: Seattle Airbnb Market Analysis

This project analyzes Seattle Airbnb data (listings, calendar prices, reviews) to uncover insights for short-term rental trends and investment opportunities.

**Key Steps:**
- Extensive data cleaning and preparation in Excel and Python: merged updated datasets, fixed formats (e.g., dates, coordinates, URLs via TEXTJOIN), handled missing values (e.g., randomizing property/bed types), and used Python for address enrichment.
- Reduced dataset from ~104M to ~15M rows to meet Tableau Public limits.
- Built interactive visualizations in Tableau: bar charts (prices/revenue by ZIP, bedrooms, neighborhoods, property types), filled maps (by location and reviews), time series (price trends 2016–2025, availability/occupancy).
- Created two dashboards highlighting price fluctuations (post-pandemic peak then cooling), top-performing areas, and efficiency (e.g., 1-bedroom properties often most profitable).
