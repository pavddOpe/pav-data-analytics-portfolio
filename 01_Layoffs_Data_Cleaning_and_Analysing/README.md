# Project 1: Data cleaning - Layoffs 2022

## What was done
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized text (ex. TRIM)
- Cleared NULLs & filling up missing spots.
- Converting data types.
- Additionally: summarizing report, data_quality_score, analitycal view.
- Prepared based on "Alex the analyst Tutorial" with my self extensions and changes.

## Files

# Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis Project - Layoffs 2022

## What was done
After the cleaning I did deeper analyze of the data:
- Max layoffs (full and percentage).
- Companies with 100% layoffs.
- Top companies, industries and stages by the calculation of layoffs.
- Timetrends - by year and month
- Added Rolling total (cumulated sum of layoffs in time) with WINDOW FUNCTIONS
- RANK of top 5 companies with the biggest layoffs (CTE+DENSE_RANK)
